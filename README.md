dotfiles
========

Manage and re-create dev env 

To install dotfiles, run `makesymlinks.sh`

To bootstrap pip/python, run `bootstrap-python-env.sh`

I am using the thinkpad t440p and I've had to make some additional
changes, most of them in the `/etc/` directory. Those files are in the
`t440p` directory
